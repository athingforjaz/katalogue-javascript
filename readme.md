# Katalogue in Javascript

Inspired by Nelson Foltz's [awesome work with C# and Ruby katas](https://github.com/nelsW70/katalogue), I am slowly converting these over to Javascript. 

## To Run
$ `npm install prompt-sync`
$ `node filename.js`

## Use
Per Nelson, "A compilation of fully functional programs that you can copy, paste, and run. The idea is for them to be used in the form of a kata as a way to learn syntax and vocabulary through repetition."

## Notes
I am adding some personal notes on what I learned through converting each kata.
